# Item Module (Remote Microfrontend)

This is the remote microfrontend for the Microfrontend Product Dashboard. It provides functionalities for creating and managing product items, and exposes its state to the host application.

## Features

- Product creation form with fields for Title, SKU, Price, and Status.
- Displays a table listing all created products.
- Allows toggling the status (Active â†” Inactive) of each product.
- Exposes its product data store to the host application for real-time metric updates.

## Setup and Run Instructions

This application is part of a larger monorepo. To set up and run it, please refer to the [root README.md](../../README.md) for comprehensive instructions.

### Development

To run only the `item-module` in development mode:

```bash
pnpm run dev --filter=item-module
```

This application typically runs on `http://localhost:5001`.

### Build

To build the `item-module` for production:

```bash
pnpm run build --filter=item-module
```

## Technical Decisions

- **Microfrontend Exposure:** Configured as a remote application using `@module-federation/vite` to expose its `App.tsx` (as `./ItemModule`) and `productStore.ts` (as `./store`).
- **State Management:** Uses Zustand for efficient and lightweight state management of product data.
- **Form Handling:** Implements `react-hook-form` with `zod` for robust form validation and submission.
- **UI Components:** Leverages `shadcn/ui` components from the shared `@repo/ui` package for consistent UI elements.
